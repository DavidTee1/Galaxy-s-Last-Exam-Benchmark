"Consider a sliding block puzzle, with a grid size of 5 rows by 4 columns as pictured in the image. The blocks cannot be removed from the grid, and may only be slid horizontally and vertically within its boundary. A move is defined as selecting a block that is slideable, and moving it by 1 unit either horizontally or vertically, whichever is possible. The image shows the starting and ending configurations of the puzzle grid. The wooden blocks are shown in various shades and the empty spaces are shown in white. What is the minimum number of moves required to reach the ending configuration from the starting configuration?",1
